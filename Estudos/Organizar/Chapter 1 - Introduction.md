[[Fundamentals of Python First Programs]]

## After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
	+ Describe the basic features of an algorithm
	+ Explain how hardware and software collaborate in a computer’s architecture
	+ Summarize a brief history of computing
	+ Compose and run a simple Python program

## Summary
	* One of the most fundamental ideas of computer science is the algorithm. An algorithm	 is a sequence of instruction for solving a problem. A computing agent can carry out these instruction to solve a problem in a finite amount of time.
	*  Another fundamental ideia of computer science is information processing. Practically any relationship among real-world objects can be represented as information or data. Computing agents manipulate information anda transform it by following the steps described in algorithms.
	* Real computing agents can be constructed out of hardware devices. These consist of a central processing unit (CPU), a memory, and input and output devices The CPU contains switches that represent binary digits. All information stores in memory is represented in binary form.  Input devices such as a keyboard and flatbed scanner and output devices such as a monitor and speakers transmit information between the computers’s memory and the external world. These devices also transfer information between a binary form and a form that human begins can use.
	* Some real computers, such as those in wristwatches and cell phones, are specialized for a small set of tasks, whereas a desktop or laptop  computer is a general-purpose problem-solving machine.
	* Software provides the means  whereby different algorithms can be run on a general  purpose hardware device .The term  /softwares/  can refer to editors and interpreters for developing programs; an operation system for managing hardwares devices; users interfaces for communicating with human users; and applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, database managers, games, and media-processing programs.
	* Softwares is written in programming languages. Languages such as Python are high level; they resemble English and allow authors to express their algorithms clearly to other people. A program called an interpreter translates a Python program to a lower-level form that a can be executed on a real computer.
	* The Python shell provides a command prompt for evaluating and viewing the results of Python expression and statements. IDLE is an integrated development environment that allows the programmer to save programs in files and load them into a she for testing.
	* Python scripts are programs that are saved n files and run from a terminal command prompt. An interactive scrip consists of a set of inputs statements, statements that process these inputs, and statements that output the results.
	* When a Python program is executed, it is translated into byte code. This byte codes is then sent to the Python virtual machine (PVM) for further interpretation and execution. 
	* Syntax is the set of rues for coming correct expression and statements in a programming language. When the interpreter encounters a syntax error in a Python program, it halts execution with an error message. Two examples of syntax erros are a referent to a variable that does not yet have a value and an indentation that is unexpected.
