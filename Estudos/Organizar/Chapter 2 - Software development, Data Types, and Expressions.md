	- [x] Use integers and floating-point numbers in arithmetic operations
	- [x] Construct arithmetic expressions
	- [x] Inicialize and use variables with appropriate names
	- [x] Import functions from library modules
	- [x] Call function with arguments and use returned values appropriately
	- [x] Construct a simple Python program that performs inputs, calculations, and outputs
	- [x] Use doctoring to documents Python programs

## Summary
- The waterfall model describes the software development process in terms of several phases. Analysis determines what the software will do. Design determines how the software will accomplish its purposes . Implementation involves coding the software in a particular programming language.  Testing and integration demonstrate that the software  does what it is intended to do as it is put together for release. Maintenance locates and fixes erros after release and adds new features to the software.
- Literals are data values that can appear in a program. They evaluate to themselves.
- The string data type is used to represent texto for input and output. Strings are sequences of characters. String literals are enclosed in pairs of single or double quotation marks. Two string can be combined by concatenation to form a new string.
- Escape characters begin with a backslash and represent special characters such as the delete key and the new line.
- A doctoring is a string enclosed by triple quotation marks and provides documentation.
- Comments ares pieces of code that are not evaluated by the interpreter bu can be read by programmers to obtain information about a program.
- Variables are names that refer to values. The value of a variable is initialized and can be reset by an assignment statement. In Python, any variable can name any value.
- The **int** data type represent integers. The **float** data type represents floating-point numbers. The magnitude of an integer or a floating-point number is limited by the memory of the computer, as is the number’s precision in the case of floating-point numbers. 
- Arithmetic operators are used to form arithmetic expression. Operands can be numeric literals, variables, function calls, or other expressions.
- The operators are ranked in precedence. In descending order, they are exposition, negation, multiplication, (*, /, and % are the same), addition (+ and - are the same), and assignment. Operation with a higher precedence are evaluated before those with a lower precedence. Normal precedence can b overridden by parentheses.
- Mixed-mode operation involve operands of difference numeric data types. They result in a value of the more incisive data type.
- The type conversion functions cab be used to convert a value of one type  to a value of another type after input.
- A function call consistes of a function’s name and its arguments or parameters. When it is called, the function’s arguments are evaluated, and these values ares passed to the function’s code for processing. When the functions completes its works, it may return a result value to te caller.
- Python is a strongly typed language. The interpreter checks the type of all operands within expressions and halts execute with an error if they are not as expected for the given operators.
- Python is a strongly typed language. The interpreter checks the types f all operands within expressions and halts execution with an error if they are not as expected the given operators. 
- A module is a set of resources, such as function definition. Programmers access these resources by importing their modules.
- A semantic error occurs when the computer cannot perform the requeste operation, such as an attempt to divid by 0. Python programs with semantic erros halt with an error message.
- A logic error occurs when a program runs to a norma termination but produces incorrect results.
