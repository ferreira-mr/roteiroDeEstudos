## Part I - Introduction to Software Engineering

### 1. Introduction
#### Objectives
The objectives of this chapter are to introduce software engineering and to proceed a framework for understanding the rest o the book. When you have read this chapter, you will:
	- understand what software engineering is and why it is importante;
	- understand that the development of different types of software system may require different software engineering techniques;
	- understand ethical and professional issues that are importante for softwares engineers;
	- have been introduced to four system, of different types, which are used as examples throughout the book.
#### Contents
	1. Professional software development
	2. Software engineering ethics
	3. Case of studies

#### Key points
	- Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
	- Software is not just a program or programs but also includes all electronic documentation that is needed by system users, quality assurance staff, and developers. Essential software product attributes ares maintainability, dependability and security, efficiency, and acceptability.
	- The software process includes all of the activities involved in software development. The high-level activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are part of all software precesses.
	- There are Manny different types of system, and each requires appropriates software engineering tools and techniques for their development. Few, if any, specific design and implementation techniques are applicable to all kinds of system.
	- The fundamental ideais of software engineering are applicable tool types of software systems. These fundamentals include managed software processes,,software dependability and security, requirements engineering, and software reuse.
	- Software engineers have responsibilities to the engineering profession and society. They should not simply be concerned with technical issues but could be aware of the ethical issues that affect theirs work.
	- Profession societies publish codes of conduct that  embed ethics and professional standards. These se out the standards of behaviors expected of their members

### 2. Software processes
#### Objectives
The objective of this chapter is to introduce you to the idea of a software process - coherent se of activities for software product. Why you have had this chapter, you will:
	- understand the concepts of software processes and software processes models;
	- have been introduced to threes general software process models and when they might be used;
	- know about the fundamental process activities of software requirements engineering software development, testing, and evolution;
	- understand why processes should be organized to cope with cadges in the software requirements and design;
	- understand the notation of software process improvement and the factors tat affect software process quality.
	
#### Contents
	1. Software process models
	2. Process activities
	3. Coping whit change
	4. Process improvement

#### Key Points
	- Software processes are the activities involves in producing a software system. Software process models are abstract representations of these process.
	- General process models describe the organization of software processes. Examples general modes include the waterfall model, incremental development, and reusable component, configuration an integration.
	- Requeriment engineering is the process of developing a software specification. Specifications are intended to communicate the system need of the custom to the system developer.
	- Design and implementation precess are concerned with transforming a requirements specification into an executable software system.
	- Software validation is the process of checking that the system comforts to its specification and that it meets the real needs of the users of the system.
	- Software takes place when you change existing software systems to meet new requirements. Changes are continuous, and the software bus evolve to remain useful.
	- Processes should include activities to cope with change. This may involve a prototyping phase hat help avoid poor decision on requirements and design. Process may be structured for iterative development and delivery so that changes may be made without disruption the system as a whole.
	- Process improvement is the process of improving existing software processes to improving existing software precesses to improve software  quality, lower development costs, or reduce development time. It is a cclic process involving process measurement, analysis, and change.

### 3. Agile software development

#### Objectives
The objective of this chapter is to introduce you to agile software development methods. When you have read the chapter you will:
	- understand the rationale for agile software development methods, the agile manifesto, and the differences between agile and plan-driven development;
	- know about importance agile development practices such as user stories, refactoring, pair programming and test-first development.
	- understand the Scrum approach to agile project management;
	- understand the issues of scaling agile development methods and combining agile approaches with plan-drive approaches in the development of large software systems.

#### Contents
	- Agile methods
	- Agile development techniques 
	- Agile project management 
	- Scaling agile methods 

#### Key Points

	- Agile methods are interactive development methods that focus on reducing process overheads and documentation and on incremental software delivery. They involve customer representatives directly in the development process.
	- The decision on whether to use an agile or plan-drive approach to development would deepen on the type of software being developed, the capabilities of the development team, and the  culture of the company development the system. In practice, a mix of agile and plan-based techniques may be used.
	- Agile development practices in crude requirements expressed as user stories, Pai programming refactoring continues integration, and test-first development.
	- Scrum is an agile method that process a framework for organising agile projects. It is centred around a self of sprints, which are fixed time periods when a system incremental is developed. Planing is base on prioritising a backloads of work and selecting the highest priority task of a sprint.
	- To scale agile methods, some plan-based practices have to be integrated with agile practice. These include up-front requirements, multiple customer requirements, multiple customer representatives, more documentation, common tooling across project Teams and the alignment of releases across teams.

### Requirements engineering

#### Objectives
 The objective of this chapter is to introduce software requirements an to explain the precesses involves in discovering and documenting theses requirement, When you have read the chapter you will:
	- understand the concepts of user and system requirements and why here’s requirements should be write in different ways;
	- understand the differences between functional and non-functional software requirements;
	- understand the main requirements engineering activities of elicitation, analysis, and validation, and the relationships between these activities;
	- understand why requirements management is necessary and how it supports other requirements engineering activities.
	
#### Contents
	- Fundamental and non-functional requirements
	- Requirements engineering processes
	-  Requirements elicitation
	- Requirements specification
	- Requirements validation
	- Requirements change
